End Notes
I'm decently impressed with my solution.
Basically it originally takes the pairs and adds those to a dictionary.
At first it just has a key = state, and values are all those directly adjacent to the key.
After this a second dictionary is created
This dictionary is similar,the key is a state but the value is a list of lists.
The position in the list is the distance of the state to the key.

Now for some actual notes:
Maybe at some point I should go back and shore up the program
Add better names for variables
Better comments
As with most things, each function should do a clear concrete thing.
I should also have more functions, each well documented.

!!!
I should check out the
Floydâ€“Warshall algorithm






"""









"""
From the original dictionary create another dict that has further roads.
Have a list of all states.
Then find the actual distance, if possible between all states.
Example:
Cowsome ['Honepy', 'Bawnty', 'Mikliday'] 2 ['Maycorn' 'Lacry', 'Mausse'] 3 ['Lednec']


Look up how to create multiple dictionary entries.

The position within the list is how many roads away the state is.
